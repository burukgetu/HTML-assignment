    <p><strong><dfn>Abebe Bikila </dfn></strong><i>(1932–1973)</i>  was an Ethiopian marathon runner who was a back-to-back Olympic marathon champion.</p>
    <h2 id="Abebe's_Early_Years">Abebe's Early Years</h2> <hr>
    <p>Abebe Bikila was born on August 7, 1932, in the small community of <abbr title="then part of the Selale District of Shewa">jato.</abbr>Abebe was the son of Wudinesh Beneberu and Demissie.During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1935–1937), his family was forced to move to the remote town of Gorro.</p>
    <p>As a young boy, Abebe played gena, a traditional long-distance hockey game played with goalposts sometimes kilometres apart.Around 1952, he joined the 5th Infantry Regiment of the Imperial Guard after moving to Addis Ababa the year before.</p>
    <p>During the mid-1950s, Abebe ran 20 km from the hills of Sululta to Addis Ababa and back every day. Onni Niskanen, a Swedish coach employed by the Ethiopian government to train the Imperial Guard, soon noticed him and began training him for the marathon.In 1956, Abebe finished second to Wami Biratu in the Ethiopian Armed Forces championship.</p>
    <h2 id="The_1960_Rome_Olympics">The 1960 Rome Olympics</h2> <hr>
    <p>The race started at the foot of the Capitoline Hill staircase and finished at the Arch of Constantine, just outside the Colosseum.Abebe and ben Abdesselam remained together until the last 500 meter. Nearing the obelisk again, Abebe sprinted to the finish.In the early-evening darkness, his path along the Appian Way was lined with Italian soldiers holding torches.Abebe's winning time was 2:15:16.2, twenty-five seconds faster than ben Abdesselam at 2:15:41.6,and breaking Popov's world record by eight tenths of a second.Immediately after crossing the finish line Abebe began to touch his toes and run in place,and later said that he could have run another 10–15 km.</p>

    <figcaption>Abebe crossing the finish line</figcaption>
    <p>Abebe returned to his homeland as a hero. He was greeted by a large crowd, many dignitaries and the commander of the Imperial Guard.Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie.The Emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal).He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle.</p>

    <details><summary>The 1961 Athens Marathon - 1964</summary> <hr>
    <aside><p>In the 1961 Athens Classical Marathon, Abebe again won while running barefoot.This was the second and last event in which he competed barefooted.The same year he won the marathons in Osaka and Košice.</p> </aside>
    <p>Abebe ran the 1963 Boston Marathon,which was between his Olympic wins in 1960 and 1964 and finished fifth in 2:24:43. This was the only time in his competitive career that he completed an international marathon without winning.</p>
    </details>
    <h2 id="1964_Tokyo_Olympics">1964 Tokyo Olympics</h2> <hr>
    <p>He entered the October 21 marathon wearing Puma shoes. This was in contrast to the previous Olympics in Rome, where he ran barefoot.Abebe entered the Olympic stadium alone, to the cheers of 75,000 spectators.The crowd had been listening on the radio and anticipated his triumphant entrance.Abebe finished with a time of<time>2:12:11.2</time> ,four minutes and eight seconds ahead of silver medallist Basil Heatley of Great Britain.Abebe did not appear exhausted after the finish, and he again performed a routine of calisthenics,which included touching "his toes twice then [lying] down on his back, cycling his legs in the air".</p>
    <p>He was the first runner to successfully defend an Olympic marathon title.As of the 2020 Olympic marathon, Abebe, Waldemar Cierpinski, and Eliud Kipchoge are the only athletes to have won two gold medals in the event, and they all did it back-to-back.</p>
    <h3>from 1965 - 1968</h3> <hr>
    <p>In 1965,Abebe returned to Japan and won his second Mainichi Marathon, held in Shiga Prefecture. In 1966 he ran marathons at Zarautz and Inchon–Seoul, winning both. The following year, Abebe did not finish the Zarautz International Marathon in July 1967.He had injured his hamstring, an injury from which he would never recover.Abebe had begun to limp,and the 1966 Incheon–Seoul Marathon was the last marathon he ever completed.</p>
    <h2>The 1968 Mexico Olympic Abebe's last tornament</h2> <hr>
    <p>Seeking a third consecutive gold medal, Abebe entered the October 20 Olympic marathon with<code> Mamo Wolde</code> and <code> Gebru Merawi</code>.Symbolically, he was issued bib number 1 for the race.A week before the race, Abebe developed pain in his left leg. Doctors discovered a fracture in his fibula, and he was advised to stay off his feet until the day of the race. Abebe had to drop out of the race after approximately 16 km (10 mi) and Mamo Wolde won in 2:20:26.4.This was Abebe's last marathon appearance.</p>
    <section>
    <h2 id="The_Accident"><big> The Accident</big></h2> <hr>
    <p>On the night of March 22, 1969, Abebe lost control of his Volkswagen Beetle and it overturned, trapping him inside.The accident left him a quadriplegic, paralysed from the neck down; he never walked again. Although Abebe could not move his head at first, his condition eventually improved to paraplegia, regaining the use of his arms.</p>
    <p> Lewis cites the discrepancy in the circumstances surrounding Abebe's car accident:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <q>driving to training in his<var> VW Beetle</var>, only to be forced off the road by a group of students ('screaming, blood-covered young men') who are being chased by armed police. The facts uncovered by Judah point to a less poetic explanation: [Abebe] was last seen in a bar at 9 pm, the roads that night were wet and he was inexperienced behind the wheel.</q></p>
    </blockquote>
    </section>
    <h2>Other competition Abebe participated in</h2> <hr>
    <p>In 1970, Abebe began training for wheelchair-athlete archery competitions.In July, he competed in archery and table tennis at the Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games in London.The following April, Abebe participated in games for disabled people in Norway.Although he had been invited as a guest, he competed in archery and table tennis and defeated a field of sixteen in cross-country sled dog racing with a time of 1:16:17.</p>
    <h2>Abebe's Death and a honorary burial</h2>
    <pre>On October 25, 1973, Abebe died in Addis Ababa at age 41 of a cerebral hemorrhage, a complication related to his accident four years earlier. He was buried with full military honours; his state funeral was attended by an estimated 65,000 people including Emperor Haile Selassie, who proclaimed a day of mourning for the country's national hero.Abebe is interred in a tomb with a bronze statue at Saint Joseph Church in Addis Ababa.</pre>

  HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) - a formatting system for displaying material retrieved over the Internet. Each retrieval unit
                                   is known as a Web page (from World Wide Web), and such pages frequently contain hypertext 
                                   links that allow related pages to be retrieved.
  HTML Verions - html 1.0 , html 2.0 , html 3.0 , html 4.0 , html 5.0

  XHTML(Extensible HyperText Markup Language) - XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and increase interoperability with other data formats. There are two main 
          reasons behind the creation of XHTML: It creates a stricter standard for making web pages, reducing incompatibilities
          between browsers. So it is compatible for all major browsers.
  XHTML Versions - XHTML 1.0 , XHTML 1.1 , XHTML basic , XHTML Mobile profile , XHTML 1.2 , XHTML 2.0 , XHTML 5.0
